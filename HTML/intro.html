          I know you love the planets. But long before science revealed their secrets, they were named after Roman gods and goddesses. Much of this was inspired from Greek mythology; the romans just gave them Latin names.
          These heavenly bodies were believed to represent and rule so many aspects of human life â€” communication and expression, love and connection, beauty and appearance, career and success, ambition and drive. 
          Their identities werenâ€™t just symbolic; they were inspired by the planets themselves â€” from Mercuryâ€™s speed to Neptuneâ€™s deep blue mystery.

          Science explains what they are. Mythology imagines who they are. And sometimes, itâ€™s in those stories that we see our lives reflect.

          Letâ€™s explore these stories together!!
