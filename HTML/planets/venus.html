            <h1>VENUS</h1>
            <p>Venus- The goddess of beauty; Romans at that time knew nothing about the truth of Venus, the planet similar to the size of the Earth but holding a harsh, hostile world with intense heat and pressure. All the Romans could see at that point in time was a bright star in the sky: a planet that reflects 70% of the sunlight due to its thick clouds and hence shines brightly in the night sky. This radiant planet, beautiful to the eyes stargazing on a dark night, was named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, Venus.
            </p>
            <p>The beauty of Venus is well talked about and she rules love and passion. She is the embodiment of love and Venus burns in the passionate and fiery love. They say to always follow your passion and something that you truly love. If there is any purpose of this life, it might as well be to follow the path of our passions and chase our dreams. At indecisive times, let's ask ourselvesâ€¦what does my heart truly want? What do I truly love?
            </p>
            <p>Connections formed in love make life worth living. I absolutely love your calmness, your discipline and your hard work. You give your absolute best to everything and that inspires me every day. Make sure you put your heart out into things that reciprocate. Make sure you are wise with building connections because your love is precious.  </p>
