            <h1>Ouranos</h1>
            <p> Uranus, the planet, indeed behaves in unconventional ways. It is the seventh planet from the Sun, and while it’s a gas/ice giant like Jupiter and Saturn, it is peculiar for its axial tilt – Uranus’s rotation axis lies almost in the plane of its orbit, tilted about 98 degrees. This means Uranus effectively rotates on its side.  
            </p>
            <p>Uranus is a special case – it’s the only planet named after a Greek deity rather than a Roman one. The name “Uranus” is the Latinized form of Greek Ouranos, the primordial god of the Sky.
                Traits of the mythic Ouranos/Caelus don’t loom large in human personality terms since he is more an elemental/protogenoi deity. Traits of Ouranos are similar to the vast sky: Innovative, unpredictable, resourceful, imaginative.    
            </p>
            <p>Life is unpredictable and comes with ebbs and flows. However, everything happens for a reason and there is always goodness that you can highlight through any circumstances. Every downfall brings with us a lesson, or an opportunity to grow. Again, we are meant to grow more resourceful. Whatever life brings you through its surprises, always believe at heart that its for a higher purpose.
