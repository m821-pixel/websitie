      <h1>MERCURY</h1>
      <p>Mercury - The messenger of god, equivalent to the greek god Hermes. As the innermost planet and only just a bit bigger than Earth’s moon, it is the swiftest in its orbit. Appropriately, Mercury is also the quickest of all Roman Gods. The element Mercury (Hg) also gets its name from the Roman god being the only metallic element that is liquid under standard conditions and flows swiftly and has very high surface tension. 
      </p>
      <p>The messenger of God, hence is known for his speed and agility and rules over communication and wit. Communication is key in every aspect of life. We spare ourselves so much time and energy during setbacks and conflicts if we are honest in our communication, with others or with ourselves, and move swiftly to finding a solution. It is often so difficult to communicate our boundaries because we want everyone around us to feel comfortable but it can come at the expense of our own comfort. Let’s remember that we are not wrong for reinforcing our boundaries and the real ones will always respect it. </p>
      <p>Mercury as a planet might have its fluctuations in temperature, but you are the most cool headed person I know. You have so much discipline over your emotions and feelings. Make sure you don't shut off from them though. If difficult emotions come up, dont run from them…Communicate it to people you trust. You already are skillful enough to lead by communicating your ideas and sharing them with people. Be more graceful with your emotions too. I am always here to listen. </p>
