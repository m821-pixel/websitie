            <h1>Jupiter</h1>
            <p>Jupiter is the giant of the solar system, more massive than all the other planets combined. Its diameter is about 143,000 km (11 Earths across). This enormity aligns perfectly with the idea of Jupiter as the most grand and expansive deity.  Jupiter (Latin Iuppiter, also called Jove) was the chief deity of Roman religion – the king of the gods, god of the sky and thunder. He wielded the thunderbolt as his weapon and oversaw laws and social order.

            <p>The king of Gods, Jupiter represents leadership, justice and wisdom. Leadership is an essential skill to have and it is your most impressive quality. As a TA, you did an excellent job mentoring your students (especially me hehe). Your calm demeanor inspired me everyday. I used to think…how can you not panic when you have a challenging question? Well, I saw you move straight to the heart of the question despite its complexities; read and reread the question. I learned so many things from the wisdom you've shared and leadership you've expressed. You never made me feel like I wasn't capable enough. Leaders like you are so easy to trust.
            </p>
            <p>Knowing what's “just” to you is important but it is equally important to stand firmly on that. Always stand firm on what you believe, but be open to constructive criticism. Ofcourse, you know it better than me.
