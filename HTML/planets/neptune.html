            <h1>Neptune</h1>
            <p> Neptune, the planet, is a deep azure blue, thanks largely to methane in its atmosphere absorbing red light. It’s the eighth planet from the Sun, orbiting every ~165 years.Neptune’s vivid blue and dynamic weather draw an instant parallel to the sea.  In fact, Neptune is named “for the Roman god of the sea, and the deep, ocean blue color of the planet reflects this”
                Neptune in astrology is associated with dreams, intuition, spirituality, and illusion.                 
            </p>
            <p>Everyone has the right to dream big. There’s a quote that says “If your dreams dont scare you, they arent big enough”. Visualize your goals, be absolutely clear on what you want to achieve and if it takes time to know yourself, let it. You dont have to figure out your life in a day. Let life unfold you. Be open to change and dont restrict yourself to chase new dreams. 
            </p>
            <p>I want to remind you that you have everything within you to make your dreams come to life. You are capable enough. What you have now is exactly what you had dreamed of at some point in the past. So dont ever think you are not equipped enough to live the life of your dreams. It might take some time and life might test you, but you got this. I believe in you and I love you.
