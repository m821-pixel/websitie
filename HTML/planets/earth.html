            <h1>TERRA MATER</h1>
            <p>Earth is our home and the only known planet teeming with life. It orbits the Sun at ~1 astronomical unit (~150 million km), in the “Goldilocks zone” where temperatures allow liquid water to persist – a crucial ingredient for life as we know it. Earth is also agriculturally abundant due to its fertile Terra (soil). 
            </p>
            <p>While Earth itself was not inspired from any Roman gods or goddesses, it was personified as the Mother Earth (Terra Mater) whom they worshipped. She embodies maternal care and represents life, fertility and creativity. Creation is a great force, The cosmos itself is constantly undergoing creation and change. Every living being undergoes the process of life and death. 
            </p>
            <p>Have you heard of “the chosen sperm” theory? The female reproductive system has a way to pick which sperm cell out of the many will win the race to contraception. WIth the specific sperm and egg that combined, the genetic makeup of your ancestors, and the countless historical events that led to your parents meeting, your probability of being born is 1 in over 400 trillion as it is often estimated. Hence, your existence is a miracle. Always remember that!
