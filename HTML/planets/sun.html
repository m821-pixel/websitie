      <h1>SOL</h1>
      <p>SOL â€” A solar deity often depicted as a radiant god riding a chariot across the sky (akin to Greek god Helios/Apollo). Sol represents the life-giving force and energy that is manifested cosmically as the Sun. The Sun is a bright star of hot plasma that radiates heat and light through nuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei to helium, sustaining life here on Earth. Being associated with Sol, this fiery center of our solar system rules light, illumination and vitality.</p>
      <p><strong>What is our identity at the core of our being?</strong> Everyone is said to have a spirit (the life force) and it is the spirit that shines and takes up space. Each of us has a unique spirit and thatâ€™s what makes us so different. It is essential to know our core values because it allows us to make better decisions and form better relationships.</p>
      <p><strong>What is most important to you in life?</strong> Even when we seek materialistic goals, thereâ€™s a deeper reason for that. Itâ€™s important to askâ€¦ what do we value money for? Is it the comfort and safety that comes with it?</p>
      <p>With honest and open discourse with ourselves, we know the reason behind our passion and desire for something. You have that fiery passion in you already and you embrace it with your hard work. Make sure you are working with purpose and intention. Set clear goals for yourself and also be clear on your WHY? You have a bright future ahead and success is inevitable. ðŸ’›âœ¨</p>
