            <h1>Mars</h1>
            <p>Mars is often called the Red Planet for its distinct rusty color when seen from Earth. This reddish hue is due to iron oxide (rust) in its soil and dust. To ancient people, that deep red suggested blood – and thus war. As a result, “the reddish color of the planet Mars led them to name it after their god of war”. As the son of Jupiter and Juno, Mars held a high place in Roman religion – second only to Jupiter in importance. 
            </p>
            <p>The god of war was depicted as a noble warrior righteous in values. As a warrior, he embodies drive, action and aggression. Life is never a bed of roses and even if we might not have to get on a battlefield and fight wars, everyone has their share of internal wars. We might have it less or more than anyone else, but everyone has them and it looks different for everyone. As important as it is to inquire what we like, it is also important to reflect on what we struggle with. 
            </p>
            <p>Many times, we hold ourselves back because our mind keeps telling us we aren’t “enough” in whatever way. We hold limiting beliefs about ourselves and that prevents us from reaching our potential. We must fight these beliefs and internal war. We must affirm to ourselves that we are enough and what we do is enough…even when we make mistakes, even when we encounter a failure. The goal is not to reach an outcome but to give our best. So, I want to remind you that you are enough.
