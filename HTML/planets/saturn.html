            <h1>Saturn</h1>
            <p>Saturn is the second-largest planet in our solar system and is instantly recognizable by its spectacular ring system. Saturn's rings are believed to have formed from the debris of comets, asteroids, or moons that broke up in orbit around Saturn, torn apart by the planet's powerful gravity. 
            </p>
            <p>Saturnus (Saturn) was a complex Roman god, originally of agriculture – particularly sowing seeds – and later associated with time and renewal. Saturn is associated with limitations, responsibilities, and structure. It represents discipline, authority, and lessons learned over time. Human beings are social… We are born into familial relationships and build many other relationships as we grow. Each relationship requires effort to foster. For some, the differences are a lot so it takes much effort while for some everything fits in so naturally. 
            </p>
            <p>Responsibilities can be a lot to bear…just like growing crops. You have to put in the effort (plant the seeds), have patience throughout the process and only then you shall enjoy your harvest. But the reward, the unconditional love and support you receive through the right relationships make it worth it. Dont take your relationships for granted, especially not with your family. You are so responsible and you never miss out in giving back to your family. They are super proud of you and so am I.
